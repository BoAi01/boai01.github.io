      abs={Developing generalist agents that can operate across diverse tasks, environments, and robot embodiments is a grand challenge in robotics and artificial intelligence. In this work, we focus on the axis of embodiment and investigate \emph{embodiment scaling laws}â€”the hypothesis that increasing the number of training embodiments improves generalization to unseen ones. Using robot locomotion as a test bed, we procedurally generate a dataset of $\sim$1,000 varied embodiments, spanning humanoids, quadrupeds, and hexapods, and train generalist policies capable of handling diverse observation and action spaces on random subsets. We find that increasing the number of training embodiments improves generalization to unseen ones, and scaling embodiments is more effective in enabling embodiment-level generalization than scaling data on small, fixed sets of embodiments. Notably, our best policy, trained on the full dataset, zero-shot transfers to novel embodiments in the real world, such as Unitree Go2 and H1. These results represent a step toward general embodied intelligence, with potential relevance to adaptive control for configurable robots, co-design of morphology and control, and beyond. }

  abs={Manipulating deformable objects like cloth is challenging due to their complex dynamics, near-infinite degrees of freedom, and frequent self-occlusions, which complicate state estimation and dynamics modeling. Prior work has struggled with robust cloth state estimation, while dynamics models, primarily based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are limited by their locality. Inspired by recent advances in generative models, we hypothesize that these expressive models can effectively capture intricate cloth configurations and deformation patterns from data. Building on this insight, we propose a diffusion-based generative approach for both perception and dynamics modeling. Specifically, we formulate state estimation as reconstructing the full cloth state from sparse RGB-D observations conditioned on a canonical cloth mesh and dynamics modeling as predicting future states given the current state and robot actions. Leveraging a transformer-based diffusion model, our method achieves high-fidelity state reconstruction while reducing long-horizon dynamics prediction errors by an order of magnitude compared to GNN-based approaches. Integrated with model-predictive control (MPC), our framework successfully executes cloth folding on a real robotic system, demonstrating the potential of generative models for manipulation tasks with partial observability and complex dynamics.}

abs={Internal world models (WMs) enable agents to understand the world's state and predict transitions, serving as the basis for advanced deliberative reasoning. Recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT-4o and Gemini, exhibit potential as general-purpose WMs. While the latest studies have evaluated and shown limitations in specific capabilities such as visual understanding, a systematic evaluation of VLMs' fundamental WM abilities remains absent. Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we propose a two-stage framework that assesses Perception (visual, spatial, temporal, quantitative, and motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation, transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce WM-ABench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations. Through 517 controlled experiments on 11 latest commercial and open-source VLMs, we find that these models exhibit striking limitations in basic world modeling abilities. For instance, all models perform at near-random accuracy when distinguishing motion trajectories. Additionally, they lack disentangled understanding---e.g., they tend to believe blue objects move faster than green ones. More rich results and analyses reveal significant gaps between VLMs and human-level world modeling.}

  abs={How can robots learn dexterous grasping skills efficiently and apply them adaptively based on user instructions? This work tackles two key challenges: efficient skill acquisition from limited human demonstrations and context-driven skill selection. We introduce AdaDexGrasp, a framework that learns a library of grasping skills from a single human demonstration per skill and selects the most suitable one using a vision-language model (VLM). To improve sample efficiency, we propose a trajectory following reward that guides reinforcement learning (RL) toward states close to a human demonstration while allowing flexibility in exploration. To learn beyond the single demonstration, we employ curriculum learning, progressively increasing object pose variations to enhance robustness. At deployment, a VLM retrieves the appropriate skill based on user instructions, bridging low-level learned skills with high-level intent. We evaluate AdaDexGrasp in both simulation and real-world settings, showing that our approach significantly improves RL efficiency and enables learning human-like grasp strategies across varied object configurations. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of our learned policies to a real-world PSYONIC Ability Hand, with a 90% success rate across objects, significantly outperforming the baseline.}

The paper proposes two types of intentions, Local Path and Environment (LPE) and Discretised Local Move (DLM), and shows that DLM is robust to significant metric positioning and mapping errors. The paper also presents Kilo-IntentionNet, an instance of the IntentionNet system using the DLM intention that is deployed on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot, and which successfully navigates through complex indoor and outdoor environments over distances of up to a kilometre with only noisy odometry.}

  abstract={Tactile feedback is critical for understanding the dynamics of both rigid and deformable objects in many manipulation tasks, such as non-prehensile manipulation and dense packing. We introduce an approach that combines visual and tactile sensing for robotic manipulation by learning a neural, tactile-informed dynamics model. Our proposed framework, RoboPack, employs a recurrent graph neural network to estimate object states, including particles and object-level latent physics information, from historical visuo-tactile observations and to perform future state predictions. Our tactile-informed dynamics model, learned from real-world data, can solve downstream robotics tasks with model-predictive control. We demonstrate our approach on a real robot equipped with a compliant Soft-Bubble tactile sensor on non-prehensile manipulation and dense packing tasks, where the robot must infer the physics properties of objects from direct and indirect interactions. Trained on only an average of 30 minutes of real-world interaction data per task, our model can perform online adaptation and make touch-informed predictions. Through extensive evaluations in both long-horizon dynamics prediction and real-world manipulation, our method demonstrates superior effectiveness compared to previous learning-based and physics-based simulation systems.}

    abstract="The data-driven approach to robot control has been gathering pace rapidly, yet generalization to unseen task domains remains a critical challenge. We argue that the key to generalization is representations that are (i) rich enough to capture all task-relevant information and (ii) invariant to superfluous variability between the training and the test domains. We experimentally study such a representation---containing both depth and semantic information---for visual navigation and show that it enables a control policy trained entirely in simulated indoor scenes to generalize to diverse real-world environments, both indoors and outdoors. Further, we show that our representation reduces the A-distance between the training and test domains, improving the generalization error bound as a result. Our proposed approach is scalable: the learned policy improves continuously, as the foundation models that it exploits absorb more diverse data during pre-training.",

    abstract={Do you want a personal housekeeper robot? This project seeks to endow robots with the capability of tidying up messy rooms with brief natural language descriptions of the environment. We address three key challenges: (i) incomplete map information in the description, (ii) commonsense understanding of object locations, and (iii) long-horizon planning and acting to achieve the objective. To tackle these challenges, we leverage Large Language Models' (LLMs) understanding of typical layouts of human-living environments and object locations, as well as programming and control skills for action execution. Specifically, we prompt ChatGPT to reconstruct complete map representations from partial descriptions, then generate a high-level action plan in the form of Python functions, and finally refine the plans with atomic actions executable by the robot. We show that our framework enables effective room rearrangement with limited human instruction guidance. On simulation and real-world maps, it is able to find a place missing out from human description within three interactions with humans. In the simulation environment, it is capable of putting more than 80\% household objects in their desired place. This study provides preliminary evidence that LLMs have common sense about the spatial layout of human-living environments and object arrangements, and this work connects this knowledge to robotics tasks.}

  abstract={How can a robot navigate successfully in rich and diverse environments, indoors or outdoors, along office corridors or trails on the grassland, on the flat ground or the staircase? To this end, this work aims to address three challenges: (i) complex visual observations, (ii) partial observability of local visual sensing, and (iii) multimodal robot behaviors conditioned on both the local environment and the global navigation objective. We propose to train a neural network (NN) controller for local navigation via imitation learning. To tackle complex visual observations, we extract multi-scale spatial representations through CNNs. To tackle partial observability, we aggregate multi-scale spatial information over time and encode it in LSTMs. To learn multimodal behaviors, we use a separate memory module for each behavior mode. Importantly, we integrate the multiple neural network modules into a unified controller that achieves robust performance for visual navigation in complex, partially observable environments. We implemented the controller on the quadrupedal Spot robot and evaluated it on three challenging tasks: adversarial pedestrian avoidance, blind-spot obstacle avoidance, and elevator riding. The experiments show that the proposed NN architecture significantly improves navigation performance.}

  abstract={Authorship attribution is the task of identifying the author of a given text. The key is finding representations that can differentiate between authors. Existing approaches typically use manually designed features that capture a dataset's content and style, but these approaches are dataset-dependent and yield inconsistent performance across corpora. In this work, we propose \textit{learning} author-specific representations by fine-tuning pre-trained generic language representations with a contrastive objective (Contra-X). We show that Contra-X learns representations that form highly separable clusters for different authors. It advances the state-of-the-art on multiple human and machine authorship attribution benchmarks, enabling improvements of up to 6.8% over cross-entropy fine-tuning. However, we find that Contra-X improves overall accuracy at the cost of sacrificing performance for some authors. Resolving this tension will be an important direction for future work. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate contrastive learning with pre-trained language model fine-tuning for authorship attribution.}
