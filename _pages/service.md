### Teaching
##### CS5478  Intelligent Robots: Algorithms and Systems - Spring 2023
- A graduate-level course on robotics covering sensors, robotic perception, motion planning, control, SLAM, POMDP, robotic manipulation and navigation. 
- I contributed to designing the final project on autonomous driving and assessing student submissions.

##### CS3244 Machine Learning - Fall 2022
- An undergraduate-level course on machine learning covering various classical machine learning and deep learning models, different learning paradigms, as well as their applications in vision, language, and robotics.
- I contributed to grading assignments and crafting final exam questions.

##### CS1101S Programming Methodology - Fall 2022
- An introductory programming module, a [JavaScript extension](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/index) of [MIT CS6.001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/), covering basic programming paradigms, robotics, and compiler design. 
- I led tutorial sessions, graded assignments, designed exam questions, and developed the student learning platform [Source Academy](https://sourceacademy.org/playground). I received a feedback score of 4.8 out of 5.0 from students, far above departmental average 4.2.
