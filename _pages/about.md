I am a first-year CSE PhD student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), advised by [Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/). I am interested in developing scalable machine learning methods that solve challenging real-world robotic tasks.

I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Statistics from the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), where I worked with [David Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dyhsu/) on long-range navigation using a [Spot](https://bostondynamics.com/products/spot/) robot. I also interned at the [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](https://svl.stanford.edu/), working with [Yunzhu Li](https://yunzhuli.github.io/) and [Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/) on learning world models for robotic manipulation.
