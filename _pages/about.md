I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), advised by [Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/) and [Henrik I. Christensen](https://hichristensen.com/). Broadly, I aim to develop principled and scalable machine learning methods for solving real-world robotic tasks. Recently, my research centers on the aspect of **embodiment** in embodied intelligence—one question being how agents learn from and generalize across diverse physical forms. Learning from human data is a special case of this broader problem.

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Statistics from the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) with the highest distinction, where I worked with [David Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dyhsu/) on long-range navigation with a [Spot](https://bostondynamics.com/products/spot/) robot. I later visited the [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](https://svl.stanford.edu/), working with [Yunzhu Li](https://yunzhuli.github.io/) and [Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/) on learning world models for robotic manipulation with multi-modal perception.
