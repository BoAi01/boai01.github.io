I am a first-year PhD student in CSE at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), advised by [Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/). I aim to develop principled and scalable machine learning methods to solve real-world robotic tasks that would otherwise be intractable.

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Statistics from the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) with the highest distinction, where I worked with [David Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dyhsu/) on long-range navigation using a [Spot](https://bostondynamics.com/products/spot/) robot. Later, I visited the [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](https://svl.stanford.edu/), working with [Yunzhu Li](https://yunzhuli.github.io/) and [Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/) on learning world models for robotic manipulation using multi-modal perception.

For master’s and undergraduate students: I dedicate 30 minutes each week to connect with students, particularly those from underrepresented groups. If you are interested in discussing career paths, graduate school, research, or potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out. I am always open to engaging conversations.
