I am currently a research engineer at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, working with [Cheston Tan](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar/about-cfar/our-team/dr-cheston-tan). I have also been collaborating with [Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/) and [Yunzhu Li](https://yunzhuli.github.io/). I am interested in learning dynamics models, sim-to-real transfer, and integrating learning and planning for mobile manipulation. 

Earlier, I was a visiting researcher intern at the [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](https://svl.stanford.edu/). I received my Bachelor's in CS from the National University of Singapore, where I worked with [David Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dyhsu/) on long-horizon visual navigation with a Spot robot. I am joining UC San Diego as a PhD student in the Computer Science and Engineering Department in 2024 fall, working with [Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/).
