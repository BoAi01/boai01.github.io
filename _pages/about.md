I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego, advised by [Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/). I am interested in world model learning, large-scale policy learning, and long-horizon skill composition for challenging mobile manipulation tasks.

I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree with a double major in Computer Science and Statistics from the National University of Singapore under the Turing Program, where I worked with [David Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dyhsu/) on long-range navigation using a [Spot](https://bostondynamics.com/products/spot/) robot. I was also a visiting student at the [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](https://svl.stanford.edu/), where I worked with [Yunzhu Li](https://yunzhuli.github.io/) and [Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/) on learning tactile-informed dynamics models for manipulating complex objects.
