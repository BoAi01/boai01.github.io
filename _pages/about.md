I am a first-year PhD student in CSE at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), advised by [Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/). I seek to develop principled and scalable machine learning methods to tackle real-world robotic tasks that are otherwise intractable.

I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and in Statistics from the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), where I worked with [David Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dyhsu/) on long-range navigation using a [Spot](https://bostondynamics.com/products/spot/) robot. I also visited the [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](https://svl.stanford.edu/), working with [Yunzhu Li](https://yunzhuli.github.io/) and [Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/) on learning world models for robotic manipulation.

For master’s and undergraduate students: I dedicate 30 minutes each week to connect with students, particularly those from underrepresented groups. If you are interested in discussing career paths, graduate school, research, or potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out. I am always open to engaging conversations.
